git clone <https://github.com/AbdullahKhames/tech-interview-handbook.git>
cd tech-interview-handbook
Make sure you have your favorite programming language and development environment set up. You're ready to dive into the world of algorithms!

# runnig the demos

for cpp files:
to compile and run the file
g++ -o the-name-of-executable-you-want -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=c++17 the-name-of-source-file-to-compile
then ./the-name-of-executable-you-want

for node files
npm start the main in it import the needed function and execute it
